# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Spots is a responsive web application that allows users to upload image links, like posts, and update their
profile information. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app uses a RESTful API to manage user data and
interactions. Media queries ensure a seamless experience across devices, while development tools like npm and
webpack streamline the build process. Design prototypes were created using Figma, with version control managed
via GitHub and the Terminal.
